//use miniproject 9/inquirer fs and classes 10/21 and 10/24
const inquirer = require('inquirer');
const fs = require('fs');

//create a html base and css for everything like in the miniproject
//create class for the emplyee that will serve as base. Then make classes for others
// per the screenshot in live class, we need manager, enginer, intern

//make an array of questions for the info that gets taken

//figure out how to discern class, maybe add a question for which to add next?
//would you like to add an employee... manager/engineer/intern

//figure out how to capture the info perhaps in an array of team members

// make a function to loop through people to add them to the template literal

// make a function to call template literal to actually generate the HTML

// the template literal needs to be a card setup bootstrap style

//create a function to start the whole process. 


//then create tests that prove this
// then pretty it up and maybe make it something cooler than manager/employee
//something D&D themed?
